### [Python for Scientific Computing in Economics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/softEcon/talks/blob/master/scientific_python/talk.ipynb)

I provide a brief introduction to different aspects of the *Python* ecosystem that are of interest to economists. The material was updated last for the [*Zurich Initiative on Computational Economics*](http://www.zccfe.uzh.ch/en/pastevents/zice16/announcement.html) in January 2016.  

### [Introduction to Software Engineering](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/softEcon/talks/blob/master/intro_software_engineering/talk.ipynb)

I provide a brief introduction to selected software engineering practices that are of interest to economists. The material was updated last for the [*Zurich Initiative on Computational Economics*](http://www.zccfe.uzh.ch/en/pastevents/zice16/announcement.html) in January 2016.  

### [Introduction to Structural Econometrics](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/softEcon/talks/blob/master/intro_structural_econometrics/talk.ipynb#/)

I provide a brief introduction to structural microeconometric models. The material is under development for the [*Zurich Initiative on Computational Economics*](http://www.zccfe.uzh.ch/en/zice17/announcement.html) in January 2017.
